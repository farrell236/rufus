# Automated builds and releases

Rufus++ has two manually dispatched workflows under the repository's
**Actions** tab. Both build the exact commit selected in GitHub's branch menu,
run the complete test suite on every target, deploy the required Qt runtime,
and package four artifacts:

| Platform | Architecture | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | x86-64 | Portable ZIP |
| Linux | x86-64 | Portable tar.gz |
| macOS | Apple Silicon (ARM64) | DMG |
| macOS | Intel (x86-64) | DMG |

## Build Development

Choose **Actions → Build Development → Run workflow**. Development packages
are retained as workflow artifacts for 14 days and do not create a Git tag or
GitHub Release. `RelWithDebInfo` is the default; `Debug` can be selected when
diagnostics are more important than package size.

## Publish Release

Choose **Actions → Publish Release → Run workflow** from the default branch and
enter a version without a `v` prefix. The workflow rejects malformed or reused
versions, builds all four packages in CMake `Release` mode, and creates the tag
only after every build and test succeeds. It then creates a draft GitHub
Release, uploads the packages and SHA-256 checksums, and leaves publication as
a deliberate manual step.

The current macOS packages are clearly named `unsigned-root` and are intended
only for controlled development and hardware qualification. They run in
restricted mode when opened normally and enable physical-device operations only
when the bundle executable is launched directly with `sudo`. They are not
Developer ID signed or notarized. A public production release still requires
the signed-helper packaging and Apple notarization workflow described in
[cross-platform.md](cross-platform.md).
